# ATTACKING WEB APPLICATIONS WITH COOMMON VULNERABILITIES

## Objective
To simulate real-world scenarios and enhance proficiency in identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities in web applications, thereby strengthening defensive strategies and fostering a proactive security posture


### Skills Learned
- Finding subdomian with asset finder.
- XXS Cross site scripting (dom,store and reflected.
- SQL  injection using Union select and blind.
- Command injection.
- Insecure file Uploads.
- Brute force
- Attacking MFA

### Tools Used
- Asset finder for finding subdomain
- local website lab for xxs,MFA,bruteforce,Insecure uploads.
- Burpsuite for identifying POST request,bruteforce attacks from localhost and SQLmap  for SQL injection.
- https://appsecexplained.gitbook.io/appsecexplained/common-vulns/injection/command-injection  a reffernce book for injections
- Hydra which i used for cracking hashes from userstable in the database
- ffuf which aided cracking passwords as another option

## Steps
1. Finding subdomain  with Asset finder
